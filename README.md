# Python-Education
This repo is mostly python practice. The main focus is understanding the language, python allows for interesting way to handle data I have not seen in other languages.

**Ex: List Comprehension**

> *[EXPRESSION **for** ITEM **in** CONTAINER **if** FILTER]*
>
> Executes the expression for each item in the container that meets the filters requirement. A filter is optional.
```python
chest =[1,2,3,4]
items = [i*2 for i in chest if i%2 == 0]
## items will be set to [4,8]
```
## Project Euler Questions
This contains my attempts at solving Project Euler Questions. An ideal solution should be easy to read, documented well, and take at most 60 seconds to find the answer. 

## SimpleScripts
Quick attempts and finding solutions to random questions I find online. Consider these sprints, with the focus being the time it took to meet the desired solution. 

## SortIt
Small project that will, once finished, organize a hard drive. 

## library
Code that may be usable in future projects.

## Notes 
Legibility and comments are something I need to work on.
